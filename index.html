    <p>
        The Angels are wasting the careers of the 2 best players that have played the game in the past 100 years. How can this be? I believe the team needs a restructure from the top down. I put less blame on the current general manager, Perry Minasian, due to him holding the position for only a year and almost no blame on the head coach, Joe Maddon, due to the fact that he walked in on an already burning dumpster fire. The blame has to fall on the owner Arte Moreno. He has proven to be the worst owner in baseball in his 20 year stretch as a team owner. He has thrown record breaking deals as lost cause players and ignored paying and promoting players that can actually contribute to a winning team. The real issue is that neither Moreno nor Minasian know how to evaluate talent.

        Lets take a look at a few names to show you what I'm talking about.

        BA:  .256<br>
        AB:   160<br>
        H:    41<br>
        RBI:  27<br>
        BB:   11<br>
        SO:   57<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The positive numbers that jump out at me are the RBI to hits ratio. For almost every 2 hits he drives in a run. That would be impressive if he wasnt hitting .256. What really jumps out to me is not good. His walk to strikout ratio is abysmal. He is on pace for over 200 strikouts and just 40 or so walks. These numbers just scream to me that he has no plate discipline and he is basically just haphazardly waving his bat at nearly every pitch he sees hoping to get lucky and make contact.

        Lets Look at a Minor league counterpart.

    <p id="one">
        <br>
        BA:  .337<br>
        AB:   163<br>
        H:    55<br>
        RBI:  17<br>
        BB:   21<br>
        SO:   11<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Lets start with the not great here. The RBI's are a little low, but not for a lack of clutch. Stefanic's batting average is phenomenal. At a glance it appears that he hits when no one is on base, could be leading off or just dumb luck. You have to believe that given more soring opportunities he would pull through. The real attention grabber here is his plate discipline. Two walks for every strikout? That is obsurdly fantastic! Stefanic is clearly seeing pitches well and has a tremendous amount of patience. You could expect the batting average to dip if when he hits the majors but his walks to strikout ratio will even out at worst! You typically see these kinds of numbers in future all stars.

        Long story short. The tools to build a playoff caliber team are there. The ownership and management refuse to aknowledge the potential and that leaves bums like me to create a website about my woes for a programming bootcamp.
